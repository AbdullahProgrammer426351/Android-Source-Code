It's good practice to include other system UI flags 
(such as SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LAYOUT_HIDE_NAVIGATION and SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LAYOUT_STABLE) 
to prevent your layout from resizing when the system bars hide and show. 
You should also make sure that the action bar
 and other UI controls are hidden at the same time.
